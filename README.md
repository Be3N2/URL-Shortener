# URL-Shortener
URL Shortener Node Project

Simple project that returns a shortened url in json format when sent a url
in the extension formatted /shorten/YourUrlHere 
With a valid url the response will be a json object containing a newUrl section that
will contain a shortened link to the inputted website.
So then by going to the extension /abc where abc is the given hex code in the newUrl it will now forward to the inputted website.

Made on glitch so go try it out: https://url-shortener-node.glitch.me/

Made with a mongoDB database hosted on mLab.
It was the first time using mongoDB and that took some time to work out but
overall it was another good project for freecodecamp.
